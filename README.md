# ðŸŽ­ Not a div

## Motivation
Through the years I've encountered numberless scenarios where a block of HTML was meaningless in a semantic way. A `<div>` or `<span>` stole the place of another HTML tag. 

From now on, everytime I face a _blank HTML_ I'll come here and update this document.

Once I get to 5 examples, I'll turn this into a blog post. Until then this is my _not a div diary_.

Will be added soon (unfortunately)...
